== Sample file 2: multiple authors ==

Author-year references can use different styles such as: cite:[Lane12b] or
citenp:[Lane12b].

Page numbers can be added: cite:[Lane12b(89)] or citenp:[Lane12b(89-93)].

A bit of pretext can be included too: See cite:[Lane12b(89)]

=== multiple refs ===

One citation can include several references, such as cite:[Lane12a,Lane12b].

These can include pages and be in-text: citenp:[Lane12a(78), Lane12b(89-93)].

And include pretext: See cite:[Lane12a, Lane12b(89-93)]

Note: citations cannot be split over lines; each citation must be on one line.
