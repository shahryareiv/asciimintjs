ORIGINAL DOCBOOK XSL STYLESHEETS
  * Norman Walsh XSL Stylesheets http://www.nwalsh.com

DOCBOOK DTD
  * Arbortex, Oasis, etc
  * See Docbook copyright

MATHML 2.0 SUPPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  xsltml (http://xsltml.sourceforge.net) by Vasil Yaroshevich is integrated as
  MathML 2.0 support. See the xsltml README file for copyright. The stylesheets
  used here are derived from the original package and are not maintained by the
  xsltml author or maintainer.

NEW TABLE SUPPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The newtbl code (http://www.vistair.com/newtbl) by David Hedley is
  included to drive the DocBook tables. This very good implementation is now the
  default and unique implementation used, so the newtbl.use parameter is
  useless. 

LATEX PACKAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The following latex packages are provided for convenience because they are
  missing in some Debian or Fedora Core default LaTeX distributions. Dblatex
  does not ensure that the package versions given here are compatible with your
  latex distribution.

  * bibtopic.sty 
  * enumitem.sty
  * ragged2e.sty
  * attachfile.sty

PASSIVETEX PACKAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Some of the Passivetex packages are provided to extend the support of Unicode
  characters. The Passivetex LICENSE file is under latex/misc/passivetex.

(G)RUBBER SUPPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A customized version of Rubber by Emmanuel Beffara 
  (http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber) is integrated to compile the
  LaTeX documents. The code used by dblatex IS NOT the official rubber package
  and is not maintained by the rubber author or maintainer. The dblatex rubber
  customization is called grubber.

PYTHON WHICH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Python which package (http://trentm.com/downloads/which/1.1.0/which-1.1.0.zip)
  is embedded in the dblatex package under lib/contrib/which and used to
  check some program dependencies during the install setup. The which license is
  here in the dblatex package: lib/contrib/which/LICENSE.txt.

MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The string-replace template by David Carlisle
  (http://www.dcarlisle.demon.co.uk/david) is extracted from pmathml.xsl
  (http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL/pmathml.xsl), one of the W3C MathML XSL
  stylesheets (http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL/Overview.html).

  The code is made available under the following conditions:
