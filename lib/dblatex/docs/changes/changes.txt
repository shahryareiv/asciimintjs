Release 0.3.9:
--------------

Enhancements:

  * a user can define its own XSLT engine with a user-defined command,
  * the rules about how the images shall be converted can be overwritten
    (Debian bug #837168).

  like DocBook FO does.

--------------

Enhancements:
- Add the endnotes feature: the <footnote>s can be turned to be end notes in
  the printed document. Some parameters are added to configure the endnotes
  display.

  configuration format. It gives a more consistent setup and more possibilities
  to configure dblatex, like overriding the commands used to convert images.

  <informalfigure> alignment
- Add a workaround to fix a Xindy bug appearing when ranges of an index
  overlap.

  segmentedlist.as.table is set to '1' or if the list-presentation Processing
  Instruction is set to 'table' (Karl O. Pinc patch). Other PIs can be used if
  a segmentedlist is formatted as a table.

Other features:
- Internal refactoring of Processing Instructions.
- Add a 'pdfscan.py' script to find out the fonts and their size used in a PDF
  file and find out how the PDF is built.

  latex styles are:
  - simple: the rendering is very close to original latex rendering
  - native: the rendering is the original rendering used to produce the
    manual (default one)
  - db2latex: the rendering tries to be as close as possible to the
    DB2LaTeX formatting.

  for the related language.

* Some latex rendering aspects are removed from the XSL stylesheets (they should
  never have been in these stylesheets): \parindent value, \parskip value,
  \thispagestyle{fancy} for pages containing chapters.

* The following XSL parameters are added:
  - latex.babel.use={0|1(default)}: set to 0 the babel package is not included
    whatever the document language is.
  - latex.babel.language: empty by default, this parameter forces the use of
    the specified babel language whatever the document language is.
  - newtbl.use={0(default)|1}: set to one use the David Hedley table support
    (very good and no Perl parsing needed).

* New table support, completely re-written by David Hedley. One can use this
  new XSL table code by setting the parameter newtbl.use=1.

* XML source files with any extension are correctly handled. Previously one
  needed to give XML files with extension .xml.
