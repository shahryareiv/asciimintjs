Some Notes:

  * `BiDiTeX' project was initially started by Artyom Tonkikh to
    support Hebrew for babel.
  
  * Khaled Hosny made few changes to the `BiDiTeX' project to
    make it compatible with XeTeX.
  
  * I renamed the project to `FriBidiXeTeX', removed unused files, 
    renamed filenames, and made few other changes.
